TailNFL is a Limnoria/Supybot plugin for providing live play-by-play data for
NFL games. Announcements in a lobby channel are made whenever games begin or
end, directing users to game-specific channels. Each game channel provides
overall game stats in the topic while displaying a summary of each play in
realtime.

TailNFL depends on the [nflgame module](https://github.com/BurntSushi/nflgame).
